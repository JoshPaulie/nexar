# Why not Nexar?

## Infancy

Project is very new and functionality is well suited for _my_ usecases.

> Issues are encouraged for features I haven't thought of.

## It's only League of Legends

Particularly League players and matches, of all game types.

No other Riot games will be supported, including "Teamfight Tactics".

Any TFT related issues or requests will be laughed at and closed.
